Hi! Welcome to the demo of my radar chart library. I'm Anand Natrajan. I
built the library used to see all of the radar charts you'll see in these
demos. There are several good radar chart libraries out there, the best
being Zalando's open source version. However, I felt I needed a few more
features (and didn't need some others), so I built my own.
</p>

<p>
Before we proceed, a few disclaimers.
<ol>
	<li>
		I needed some data, so I copied data about different countries from
		well-known reference sites like Wikipedia, World Population Review,
		PopulationData.net, World Bank, and of course, Google. Any errors
		that remain were probably a result of my faulty cut-paste.
	</li>
	<li>
		I am <em>not</em> trying to make any political statements with this
		data. Heck, I don't even care if the data is accurate or not
		(though I tried to pick the most accurate 2021 data). I am trying
		to demo a charting tool, that's all.
	</li>
	<li>
		I am not very artistic. Often my choices of colours and fonts
		are... hideous. Luckily, you can impose your own aesthetic on my
		library.
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, thanks to the many people who gave me constructive
		feedback, and my employer (Discovery, Inc.) for letting me work on
		this, and making it open-source.
	</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Now, <em>let's see some charts!!</em> We'll start with a pretty basic one
for <a href="radarDemo1.html">the first demo</a>.
